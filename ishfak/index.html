                        <h3>Men</h3>
                        <p>“I like when a man has one strong accessory. If it’s a watch, it has to be major. If you have strong shoes, it should just be the shoes. I don’t like when a man is overdone-that’s just bad taste. Coco Chanel was always saying you have to watch yourself in the mirror, put on a lot of things, and then take them off. I think it should be that way for men as well.”</p>

                        <p>"Fashion you can buy, but style you possess. The key to style is learning who you are, which takes years. There's no how-to road map to style. It's about self expression and, above all, attitude."</p>
